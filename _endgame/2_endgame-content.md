# FFXIV Endgame Content  

Endgame content in FFXIV consists of challenging, optional encounters designed to test your skills and teamwork. These fights often feature complex mechanics and multiple phases, with rewards that help you progress toward better gear. Most endgame content requires a **Full Party** of 8 players, although some categories differ.  

Endgame activities are divided into several categories, each catering to different levels of challenge and progression:  

## **Extremes**  
- **What are they?**  
  - Extreme Trials are harder versions of Main Scenario Quest (MSQ) trials.  
- **Difficulty Level:**  
  - Considered the entry point to endgame content, Extremes are more forgiving than other categories and are beginner-friendly.  
- **Rewards:**  
  - Weapons and accessories with relevant item levels.  
  - Unique mounts or cosmetics.  
- **Purpose:**  
  - A stepping stone for players transitioning into raiding.

## **Savage Raids**  
- **What are they?**  
  - Savage Raids are the core of FFXIV’s endgame, featuring more complex mechanics and higher difficulty than Extremes.  
- **Structure:**  
  - Released in **tiers**, each tier includes **4 levels** (commonly called "floors").  
  - Progression is sequential: you must clear each floor to unlock the next.  
- **Rewards:**  
  - High item-level gear, including augmentation pieces.  
  - Unique mounts and other collectibles.  
- **Frequency:**  
  - Introduced in **even-numbered patches** (e.g., 7.0, 7.2, 7.4).  
- **Weekly Lockout:**  
  - Savage content has a **weekly loot lockout**, limiting the number of rewards you can earn per week to encourage balanced progression.

## **Ultimate Raids**  
- **What are they?**  
  - Ultimate Raids represent the pinnacle of difficulty in FFXIV, designed for the most dedicated players.  
- **Unique Features:**  
  - Cannot be entered **undersized** or **unsynced**. Players are always synced to the level and item level the raid was originally designed for.  
  - Features intricate mechanics and extremely tight performance requirements.  
- **Rewards:**  
  - Exclusive titles, weapons, and mounts.  
- **Frequency:**  
  - Introduced in **odd-numbered patches** (e.g., 7.1, 7.3, 7.5). Each expansion typically includes 1–2 Ultimate Raids.  
- **Weekly Lockout:**  
  - Like Savage, Ultimate Raids have a weekly lockout during their initial release period.

## **Criterion Dungeons**  
- **What are they?**  
  - Criterion dungeons are high-difficulty encounters designed for **Light Parties** of 4 players.  
- **Features:**  
  - Combines dungeon-style progression with raid-level mechanics.  
  - Encourages strong teamwork and communication in a smaller group setting.  
- **Rewards:**  
  - Rare loot and materials for high-level crafting.

## **Weekly Lockouts Explained**  
A **weekly lockout** is a system that restricts players from farming loot multiple times in the same week. Here's how it works:  
1. **Loot Limit:**  
   - You can only receive loot once per week from specific encounters.  
   - After earning loot from a fight, you can still participate to help others, but you won’t receive additional rewards until the weekly reset.  
2. **Weekly Reset:**  
   - FFXIV’s weekly reset occurs every Tuesday, at which point all lockouts are lifted.  
3. **Purpose:**  
   - Ensures balanced progression across the player base.  
   - Encourages players to revisit content over time rather than completing everything in one sitting.  

Endgame content offers a wide range of challenges and rewards for players looking to test their limits, improve their skills, and collect unique gear and cosmetics. Whether you're a new raider or a seasoned pro, there's always something to strive for!
