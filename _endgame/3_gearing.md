# Gearing Up  

To participate in endgame content, you need gear with a minimum **iLvl** (item level). As you progress through challenges, you earn better gear, eventually reaching **Best-in-Slot (BiS)**.  

## Gear Progression  

Gear progression in FFXIV follows a natural path:  
1. Start with the highest iLvl gear you can access.  
2. Progress through content to earn stronger gear.  
3. Repeat until you achieve BiS.  

### Key Stages of Gear Progression  

#### **Crafted Gear**  
- When a new Savage tier is released, new crafted gear becomes available.  
- Crafted gear matches the iLvl requirement for the first floor of Savage raids.  
- Obtainable via:  
  - **Market Board**: Purchase from other players.  
  - **Crafters**: Ask a friend to craft it for you.  

#### **Extreme Trial Weapons**  
- Each Savage tier is typically accompanied by an Extreme Trial.  
- Extreme Trials are harder versions of MSQ Trials.  
- Rewards include weapons with iLvl relevant to the current Savage tier.  

#### **Tomestone Gear**  
- Tomestone gear is introduced with each new Savage tier.  
- Obtainable by spending **Tomestones**, a currency earned from:  
  - Current dungeons.  
  - Daily and weekly roulettes.  
- **Tomestone Limit**: Capped at 450 per week.  
- **Upgrading Tomestone Gear**:  
  - Use augment items dropped in the current Savage tier to increase their iLvl.  

#### **Savage Rewards**  
- Savage raids drop powerful gear as direct rewards.  
- Completing Savage helps you climb closer to BiS.  
- Yes, you gear up *to get more gear*. Thatâ€™s the grind!  

### **Best-in-Slot (BiS)**  
- **BiS** refers to the optimal gear set for maximizing damage or healing output for your job.  
- Determined through community testing and math (shoutout to the *Math Wizards* on **The Balance**).
