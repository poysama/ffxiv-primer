# Mastering Your Job  

Endgame content in FFXIV can be challenging. Fights are designed with an **Enrage Timer**:  
- If the boss isn’t defeated within a set time, it will unleash a wipe-inducing attack.  

To beat these fights, you need to maximize your damage output, which is where **Job Mastery** comes in.  

## Why Job Mastery Matters  
At its core, a boss fight is a race to bring its HP to **0** before enrage. For example:  
- If a boss has **20,000,000 HP** and enrages in **12 minutes**, your group needs to deal **27,778 DPS** to win.  

This means every player’s contribution matters, whether you're a **DPS**, **Tank**, or **Healer**. Mastering your job isn’t just about doing damage—it’s about knowing what to do at the right time:  
- **DPS**: Maximize damage output.  
- **Tanks**: Maintain uptime while managing defensive tools.  
- **Healers**: Balance healing and contributing damage.  

## Key Concepts  

### **Openers**  
- An **Opener** is the sequence of abilities used at the start of a fight to maximize burst damage during cooldown windows.  
- Proper openers align your strongest abilities with group buffs, ensuring maximum team DPS.

### **Rotations**  
- A **Rotation** is the sequence of abilities used throughout a fight to maintain optimal damage.  
- Rotations can change depending on mechanics, downtime, or phase transitions.  

Mastering your job takes time and practice, but the payoff is worth it—contributing to your team’s success while experiencing the full potential of your job.
