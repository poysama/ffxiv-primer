# Old Content or Off-season content

- Content that sees less activity between patch cycles when players focus on newer content or other activities.

## Relevant content
- This are fights or challenges are are on-patch / new.


## Why isn't anyone doing X content nowadays?
Older Ultimate raids or less rewarding content may be harder to find parties for during offseasons.

## What can I do to play older content?

### Ultimates
- Even on lower levels, Ultimates are always challenging content and they reward glowy weapons which makes them relevant content.

### Savage
- Off-patch or previous Savage content are mostly dead when it's not relevant content

### Extreme
- Old extreme content are more relevant than older Savage contents due to its mount rewards.

### Advice
