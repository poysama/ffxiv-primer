## Raiding Mindset
Having the right mindset is essential for both individual and team success in raiding. A good raider adapts to challenges, maintains a positive attitude, and consistently strives for improvement.

### **Progging (Progression Raiding)**

Progressing through a new raid tier can be a rollercoaster. Progging requires patience, persistence, and teamwork as you explore the mechanics, learn encounters, and refine your strategies. Focus on the following:
- **Learning the Mechanics**: Prioritize understanding boss abilities, positioning, and any unique mechanics.
- **Adaptation**: Don’t be afraid to fail. Learn from wipes, make adjustments, and keep improving.
- **Communication**: Clear and concise communication with your team is critical, especially when encountering complex raid mechanics.

### **Clearing**

Once you’ve gotten the mechanics down, the goal shifts to clearing the raid encounter efficiently. To clear a fight, ensure that:
- **Consistency is Key**: Make sure everyone is executing their roles perfectly and minimizing mistakes.
- **Time Management**: Avoid wasting time between pulls. This includes avoiding unnecessary discussions and staying focused on each attempt.
- **Performance**: While clearing is the priority, optimizing your role and minimizing downtime can help you progress faster and more smoothly.

### **Parsing**

Parsing refers to analyzing your damage output (and other performance metrics) using tools like FFLogs. While it’s not the primary focus of progression, it’s important for improving your playstyle and fine-tuning your DPS.

- **Focus on the Fundamentals**: Parsing helps identify weak points in your rotations and cooldown management.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Don’t focus solely on perfect parses, but strive to consistently improve your performance over time.
- **Healthy Competition**: Healthy competition within your raid group can motivate each member to maximize their potential, but avoid becoming too focused on the numbers at the expense of overall raid success.

## Understanding 1-min and 2-min Bursts

In most modern raids, the timing of your burst phases is crucial for maximizing DPS. Knowing when to use your most powerful abilities (1-min and 2-min burst windows) can make a significant difference in your raid performance.

- **What are Raid Buffs?**
  - Raid buffs are special abilities that has a usual cooldown of 2-minutes that buffs overall damage for all players. These buffs are mostly party-wide but some are targeted to the boss, and understanding when to use them and when to sync with other players is vital for maximizing raid efficiency.

## Reading FFLogs and Parsing
FFLogs is a powerful tool that allows you to analyze your performance in raids. Understanding how to read and interpret these logs is essential for improving both individual and team performance.

### **Using FFLogs for Progression**
- **Compare Logs**: Compare your logs to others in your raid or other raiders online to identify areas of improvement.
- **Weaknesses**: Look for recurring issues such as poor cooldown usage, lack of uptime, or missed skill rotations.
- **Team Coordination**: Look at the overall team performance in the log to spot patterns that can help everyone improve, not just you.
