# Macros, Images and Pastebins

## Understanding Macros in Japanese Data Centers

- Endgame content often requires a full party, but finding consistent teammates isn’t always possible.  
- The **Party Finder** helps, but playing with strangers can be challenging, especially on **Japanese Data Centers** where most players speak Japanese.  
- **Macros** simplify communication by:  
  - Assigning roles and positions for mechanics.  
  - Outlining strategies in short, clear text commands.  
- Sharing macros in party chat ensures everyone knows their responsibilities, even with language differences.  

An example of a Macro is show below:

```
【Virtual Shift 1 (Wind)】
　MT-group stack　　　DPS chains
　TH chains　　　　ST-group stack
【Virtual Shift 2 (Earth)】
　D1/MT 　ST/D2 　■ 2 towers　↑：MTRH：↓
　D3/H1 　H2/D4　■ Drop rocks　↑：M　↓：T
【Weighty Blow】Start NW, go CW
【Absolute Authority】
　D1/MT　　　　　 D2/ST 　※ E/W Flares make
　D3/H1　(stack)　D4/H2　　　pairs after
【Virtual Shift 3 (Ice)】
　□　　　　　□　　↑：Use north bridge
↓□　　□　　□↓　↓：Use south bridge
↑□　　□　　□↑　　※ side players return first
　   ↑  ↓  ↓  ↑　　　Tethers：M→T→T→T
```

## Macro Job Roles
[Tuufless' Guide on Terminologies](https://ffxiv.tuufless.com/terminology)

### Tanks

* Who MTs (main-tanks) and who STs (sub-tanks) generally follows this order:

MT : WAR > DRK > GNB > PLD : ST

* A note on tank swaps: Sometimes, the “MT” position refers to the original maintank, and sometimes “whoever happens to be tanking the boss at the time”. As a general rule, if where the boss faces is relevant, then “MT” will refer to whoever is currently tanking the boss.
* Other regions (NA/EU/AU) will call the ST the OT instead (off-tank).

### Healers
* H1 is the “pure healer” (WHM, AST).
* H2 is the “barrier healer” (SCH, SGE).

### DPS
The standard composition consists of one melee, one physical ranged, one caster, and one flex DPS (typically a second melee/caster).

* D1 is the melee spot (SAM, DRG, MNK, NIN, RPR, VPR).
* D2 is the flexible DPS slot, and is typically a second melee or caster.
* D3 is a physical ranged (BRD, DNC, MCH).
* D4 is a caster (BLM, PCT, RDM, SMN).
