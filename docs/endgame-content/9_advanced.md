## Mitigations and Keeping the Party Alive
### Tankbusters

**Tankbusters** are powerful attacks specifically designed to target the tank(s) in the party. These mechanics test the tank's ability to mitigate damage and the healer's ability to respond effectively. Mishandling a tankbuster can result in the tank’s death and possibly a raid wipe.

#### Types of Tankbusters

1. **Single-Target Tankbusters**  
   - A focused, high-damage attack on the main tank.  
   - *Examples*: Magic-based attacks or simple heavy physical strikes.  

2. **Multi-Hit Tankbusters**  
   - A sequence of rapid, high-damage attacks targeting the tank.  
   - *Examples*: *Double Cleave* or *Ravage*.  

3. **Shared Tankbusters (Stacked)**  
   - Damage must be shared between two tanks to avoid overwhelming a single one.  
   - *Examples*: *Earthshaker* or *Fatal Cleave*.  

4. **AoE Tankbusters (Cone/Line)**  
   - Attacks aimed at the tank but affect anyone caught in their path.  
   - *Examples*: Wide frontal cleaves or line attacks.  

#### Key Mechanics for Tankbusters

- **Mitigation**  
  - Tanks should use personal cooldowns like *Rampart*, *Sentinel*, *Nebula*, or *Shadow Wall*.  
  - Coordinate with healers for additional mitigation like *Divine Benison* (White Mage) or *Excogitation* (Scholar).  

- **Tank Swapping**  
  - Some tankbusters apply a debuff (e.g., *Vulnerability Up*) that requires a tank swap. Use abilities like *Shirk* or *Provoke* to transfer aggro smoothly.  

- **Positioning**  
  - Ensure the tank positions the boss to prevent cone or line-based tankbusters from hitting other party members.

### Raidwide Attacks

**Raidwide Attacks** are mechanics designed to deal damage to all players in the party. They test the group’s collective survivability and the healers’ ability to recover afterward.

#### Types of Raidwide Attacks

1. **Magic Damage Raidwides**  
   - The most common type, dealing heavy magic damage to the entire party.  
   - *Examples*: *Ecliptic Meteor* (Hades EX), *Forsaken* (Alexander Ultimate).  

2. **Physical Damage Raidwides**  
   - Less common but still significant. These deal physical damage to the party.  
   - *Examples*: *Fell Ruin* from certain bosses.  

3. **DoT-Based Raidwides**  
   - Apply a damage-over-time (DoT) effect to the entire party.  
   - *Examples*: *Burn* or *Bleed* effects following a large AoE.  

4. **Unavoidable Raidwides**  
   - These are scripted, unavoidable mechanics that must be mitigated and healed through.  
   - *Examples*: *Gigaflare* (Bahamut) or *Delta Attack* (Omega).  

#### Key Mechanics for Raidwides

- **Mitigation**  
  - Use party-wide mitigation abilities such as:
    - *Sacred Soil* (Scholar)  
    - *Dark Missionary* (Dark Knight)  
    - *Shake It Off* (Warrior)  
    - *Addle* (Caster DPS).  

- **Healing**  
  - Healers should plan burst healing immediately after raidwides with abilities like:
    - *Whispering Dawn* (Scholar)  
    - *Asylum* (White Mage)  
    - *Essential Dignity* (Astrologian).  

- **Shields**  
  - Apply shields to minimize incoming damage, using spells like:
    - *Succor* (Scholar)  
    - *Divine Veil* (Paladin)  
    - *Collective Unconscious* (Astrologian).  

- **Positioning**  
  - Be prepared for follow-up mechanics like knockbacks or AoEs. Stay in safe zones when raidwides occur.

#### Examples of Raidwide Attacks

- *Gigaflare* from Bahamut (The Binding Coil of Bahamut).  
- *Judgment Volts* from Ramuh (The Striking Tree EX).  
- *Delta Attack* from Omega (Deltascape).

## Raiding Mindset
Having the right mindset is essential for both individual and team success in raiding. A good raider adapts to challenges, maintains a positive attitude, and consistently strives for improvement.

### **Progging (Progression Raiding)**

Progressing through a new raid tier can be a rollercoaster. Progging requires patience, persistence, and teamwork as you explore the mechanics, learn encounters, and refine your strategies. Focus on the following:
- **Learning the Mechanics**: Prioritize understanding boss abilities, positioning, and any unique mechanics.
- **Adaptation**: Don’t be afraid to fail. Learn from wipes, make adjustments, and keep improving.
- **Communication**: Clear and concise communication with your team is critical, especially when encountering complex raid mechanics.

### **Clearing**

Once you’ve gotten the mechanics down, the goal shifts to clearing the raid encounter efficiently. To clear a fight, ensure that:
- **Consistency is Key**: Make sure everyone is executing their roles perfectly and minimizing mistakes.
- **Time Management**: Avoid wasting time between pulls. This includes avoiding unnecessary discussions and staying focused on each attempt.
- **Performance**: While clearing is the priority, optimizing your role and minimizing downtime can help you progress faster and more smoothly.

### **Parsing**

Parsing refers to analyzing your damage output (and other performance metrics) using tools like FFLogs. While it’s not the primary focus of progression, it’s important for improving your playstyle and fine-tuning your DPS.

- **Focus on the Fundamentals**: Parsing helps identify weak points in your rotations and cooldown management.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Don’t focus solely on perfect parses, but strive to consistently improve your performance over time.
- **Healthy Competition**: Healthy competition within your raid group can motivate each member to maximize their potential, but avoid becoming too focused on the numbers at the expense of overall raid success.

## Raid buffs and Understanding 1-min and 2-min Bursts

### Why Are Raid Buffs Important?

The key to maximizing raid DPS is **synchronizing** these buffs with the party's burst windows. Properly aligned raid buffs amplify individual burst phases, creating a compounding effect that dramatically increases overall damage..

### **What are Raid Buffs?**

**Raid buffs** are abilities with a **2-minute cooldown** that temporarily boost the damage output of all party members, typically for around **20 seconds**. These buffs fall into two main categories:

1. **Party-wide Buffs**:  
   Abilities that directly increase the party’s damage, such as:
   - *Battle Litany* (Dragoon)
   - *Brotherhood* (Monk)
   - *Divination* (Astrologian)
   - *Arcane Circle* (Reaper)

2. **Boss-targeted Debuffs**:  
   Abilities that increase the damage the boss takes, such as:
   - *Trick Attack* (Ninja)
   - *Chain Strategem* (Scholar)
   - *Radiant Finale* (Bard)
  

### What Are 1-Minute Bursts?

**1-minute bursts** are damage spikes that occur during the cooldown of abilities that recharge on a 1-minute timer. These abilities aren’t typically synchronized with **raid buffs** but still represent a significant portion of your personal damage output.

### Purpose of 1-Minute Bursts

- **Building Momentum**: They serve as smaller bursts that keep DPS steady while preparing for the major **2-minute burst**.  
- **Cooldown Management**: Proper use of these abilities ensures your rotation aligns smoothly with raid buffs later.

### Examples of 1-Minute Burst Abilities

Here are examples of key abilities that align with 1-minute bursts for different jobs:

- **Dragoon**: *Lance Charge* and *Stardiver*  
- **Samurai**: *Meikyou Shusui* with *Midare*  
- **Reaper**: *Gluttony*  
- **Dark Knight**: *Bloodspiller* spam during *Delirium*  

#### Key Considerations for 1-Minute Bursts
- **Resource Preparation**: Use 1-minute bursts to generate resources (e.g., MP, gauge, or procs) for the next major burst.
- **Overcapping**: You should use your 1-minute cooldowns and OGCDs to avoid overcapping.
  
### **2-Minute Burst**: 
2-minute bursts are your **Raid Buffs** after your Opener. This will ideally happen and become available every 2-mins. It is important that all party members sync casting their raid buffs in order to maximize damage output during the 20-second window. 

#### Key Considerations for 2-Minute Bursts
- **Maximize Resources**: Ideally enter the 2-minute burst with full job gauge.
- **Ability Prioritization**: Use your hardest-hitting abilities within this window.

## Reading FFLogs and Parsing
FFLogs is a powerful tool that allows you to analyze your performance in raids. Understanding how to read and interpret these logs is essential for improving both individual and team performance.

### **Using FFLogs for Progression**
- **Compare Logs**: Compare your logs to others in your raid or other raiders online to identify areas of improvement.
- **Weaknesses**: Look for recurring issues such as poor cooldown usage, lack of uptime, or missed skill rotations.
- **Team Coordination**: Look at the overall team performance in the log to spot patterns that can help everyone improve, not just you.
