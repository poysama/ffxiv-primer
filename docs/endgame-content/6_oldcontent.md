# Old Content or Off-Patch Content  

An explanation of older endgame content, which refers to challenges released in previous patches or expansions.  

## What Is Current Content?  
- **Current Content**: Endgame challenges from the latest expansion or recent patch.  
- **Old Content**: Anything released before the latest expansion or current patch cycle.  

## Why Don’t Players Do Older Endgame Content?  
- **Reduced Challenge**: Newer gear makes it easier than when it was current.  
- **Outdated Rewards**: Gear rewards have lower iLvl and aren’t relevant anymore.  
- **Level Gap**: Older content was balanced for past level caps (e.g., Level 70 or 80).  

## Why Should You Do Older Endgame Content?  
- **Mounts**: Unique mounts drop from the last floor of Savage raid tiers.  
- **Glamour**: Savage gear often looks amazing for glamour purposes.  
- **Just Because**: It is fun and you get to experience old fights!

## Why Isn’t Anyone Doing X Content?  
Imagine this: You reach level 70, find an Ultimate Raid in Party Finder, and wait for hours with no one joining. Why does this happen?  

- **Already Cleared**: Veteran players have done it enough and don’t return.  
- **Focus on Current Content**: Most players prioritize the latest challenges.  
- **No Need for Rewards**: Players already have the mounts or gear they wanted.  
- **Small sync playerbase content**: It's insanely niche to find people willing to do old content on sync.

## How to Play Older Content  

### Ultimates  
- **Always Relevant**: Ultimates are synced to their original level cap and remain challenging.  
- **Glowy Weapons**: These weapons are always sought after, keeping Ultimates semi-current.  

### Savage  
- **Off-Patch Savage**: Generally “dead” outside current content cycles.  
- **Synced Fight Resources**: There are google docs that let you challenge these fights on an almost equal level as they were on released through the use of manual item level downsync.

### Extreme  
- **More Activity**: Older Extreme Trials are more active than Savage due to mount rewards.  

### Tips for Tackling Older Content  
- Plan to run older content during downtime between patches.  
- Join or create static groups focused on older challenges.  
- Statics usually use old content to trial new members.
